# What is RPA and Its Tools

## What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)?
Robotic process automation (RPA), also known as software robotics, uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive office tasks of human workers, such as extracting data, filling in forms, moving files, and more.

RPA combines APIs and user interface (UI) interactions to integrate and perform repetitive tasks between enterprise and productivity applications. By deploying scripts that emulate human processes, RPA tools complete autonomous execution of various activities and transactions across unrelated software systems. This form of automation uses rule-based software to perform business process activities at a high volume, freeing up human resources to prioritize more complex tasks. RPA enables CIOs and other decision makers to accelerate their digital transformation efforts and generate a higher return on investment (ROI) from their staff.

## RPA and Intelligent Automation
To remain competitive, RPA tools must expand beyond task automation to include intelligent automation (IA). This type of automation incorporates sub-disciplines of artificial intelligence, like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. Intelligent process automation demands more than the simple rule-based systems of RPA. RPA performs tasks, while AI and ML encompass the thinking and learning aspects, respectively. AI trains algorithms using data so the software can perform tasks more efficiently.

## RPA and Artificial Intelligence
RPA is often mistaken for artificial intelligence (AI), but the two are distinctly different. AI combines cognitive automation, ML, NLP, reasoning, hypothesis generation, and analysis. The critical difference is that RPA is process-driven, whereas AI is data-driven. RPA bots follow processes defined by an end user, while AI bots use machine learning to recognize patterns in data and learn over time. AI simulates human intelligence, while RPA replicates human-directed tasks. AI can help RPA automate tasks more fully and handle more complex use cases.

## How Does RPA Work?
According to Forrester, RPA software tools must include the following core capabilities:
- Low-code capabilities to build automation scripts
- Integration with enterprise applications
- Orchestration and administration including configuration, monitoring, and security

RPA can access information through legacy systems and integrates well with other applications through front-end integrations. This allows the automation platform to behave similarly to a human worker, performing routine tasks like logging in and copying and pasting from one system to another.

## Benefits of RPA
- **Less Coding**: RPA does not necessarily require a developer to configure; drag-and-drop features in user interfaces make it easier to onboard non-technical staff.
- **Rapid Cost Savings**: Since RPA reduces the workload of teams, staff can be reallocated to other priority work, leading to increases in productivity and ROI.
- **Higher Customer Satisfaction**: Bots and chatbots can work around the clock, reducing wait times for customers.
- **Improved Employee Morale**: By lifting repetitive tasks off your team, RPA allows people to focus on more strategic decision-making.
- **Better Accuracy and Compliance**: RPA robots can be programmed to follow specific workflows and rules, reducing human error.
- **Existing Systems Remain in Place**: RPA software does not disrupt underlying systems because bots work on the presentation layer of existing applications.

## Challenges of RPA
- **Organizational Culture**: RPA will reduce the need for certain job roles but will also drive growth in new roles. Promoting a culture of learning and innovation is important.
- **Difficulty in Scaling**: Scaling RPA can be challenging due to regulatory updates or internal changes. Few RPA initiatives progress beyond the first 10 bots.

## RPA Use Cases
- **Banking and Financial Services**: Automating tasks like customer research, account opening, inquiry processing, and anti-money laundering.
- **Insurance**: Automating claims processing, regulatory compliance, policy management, and underwriting tasks.
- **Retail**: Improving customer relationship management, warehouse and order management, customer feedback processing, and fraud detection.
- **Healthcare**: Optimizing information management, prescription management, insurance claim processing, and payment cycles.

## RPA Tools
RPA tools help users configure tasks to be automated. These tools utilize bots for automation. Some popular RPA tools are:

### UiPath
A highly extensible RPA tool that helps automate desktop or web applications. It includes a community edition with drag-and-drop features, making it accessible to non-programmers.

### Blue Prism
Provides a virtual workforce to automate manual, repetitive, and rule-based business processes. It supports multiple platforms and includes robust features like load balancing and data encryption.

### Automation Anywhere
Combines RPA with intellectual elements like language understanding and reading unstructured data. It offers bank-grade security and scriptless automation.

### Pega
Automates routine tasks using the UI of existing applications. It provides a cloud-based solution and does not store execution data in a database.

### WorkFusion
A SaaS cloud computing platform that automates monitoring of data feed and helps manage crowd-sourced workers. It supports quick start/stop automation.

### Jacada
Supports Desktop Automation to increase accuracy and productivity. It includes hybrid RPA capabilities combining attended and unattended bots.

### WinAutomation
A windows-based desktop automation tool that provides enterprise-grade security and controls. It supports parallel execution during testing.

### NICE Systems
An intelligent RPA tool also known as NEVA. It operates on both cloud and on-premise business software and supports attended and unattended automation.

### Contextor
An integrated development environment for robotic automation processes. It offers drag-and-drop configuration and can monitor processes executed on the workstation.

## Core Functionalities of RPA Tools
- Interaction with other systems through Screen Scraping or API Integration.
- Decision-making capabilities based on inputs from other systems.
- An interface to program other robots.

## Choosing the Right RPA Tool
Consider the following parameters:
- **Technology**: The RPA tool must be platform-independent and support all applications.
- **Scalability**: The tool should support expansion of the robotic workforce.
- **Security**: Measure all security controls to protect data.
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Evaluate the cost of the RPA tool with the company's roadmap in mind.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Ensure compatibility with existing legacy systems.
- **Ease of Use & Control**: The tool should be flexible and easy to use.
- **Vendor Experience**: An experienced vendor can improve implementation speed.
- **Maintenance & Support**: Choose vendors with strong support services.
- **Quick Deployment**: The tool should support interaction with applications at the presentation layer.

By understanding these aspects, organizations can effectively choose and implement the right RPA tools to optimize their processes.
